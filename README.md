# Mikrotik

This is a REST API wrapper for [Mikrotik's Router OS](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/REST+API).

# Notes

It'll most likely only have methods/functions that I will need for my own use cases. Please create an issue if a method you need is missing or better yet, please send a PR!
